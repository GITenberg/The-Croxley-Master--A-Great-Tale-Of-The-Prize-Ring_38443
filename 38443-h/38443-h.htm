<h2>I</h2>

<p class="cap">MR. ROBERT MONTGOMERY was
seated at his desk, his head upon his
hands, in a state of the blackest despondency.
Before him was the open ledger with the long
columns of Dr. Oldacre's prescriptions. At
his elbow lay the wooden tray with the labels
in various partitions, the cork box, the lumps
of twisted sealing-wax, while in front a rank of
empty bottles waited to be filled. But his spirits
were too low for work. He sat in silence, with
his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his
hands.</p>

<p>Outside, through the grimy surgery window
over a foreground of blackened brick and slate,
a line of enormous chimneys like Cyclopean
pillars upheld the lowering, dun-coloured cloud-bank.
For six days in the week they spouted
smoke, but to-day the furnace fires were banked,
for it was Sunday. Sordid and polluting gloom
hung over a district blighted and blasted by the
greed of man.   There was nothing in the surroundings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to cheer a desponding soul, but it
was more than his dismal environment which
weighed upon the medical assistant.</p>

<p>His trouble was deeper and more personal.
The winter session was approaching. He should
be back again at the University completing the
last year which would give him his medical degree;
but alas! he had not the money with which
to pay his class fees, nor could he imagine how he
could procure it. Sixty pounds were wanted to
make his career, and it might have been as
many thousands for any chance there seemed to
be of his obtaining it.</p>

<p>He was roused from his black meditation by
the entrance of Dr. Oldacre himself, a large,
clean-shaven, respectable man, with a prim
manner and an austere face. He had prospered
exceedingly by the support of the local
Church interest, and the rule of his life was
never by word or action to run a risk of offending
the sentiment which had made him. His
standard of respectability and of dignity was
exceedingly high, and he expected the same
from his assistants. His appearance and words
were always vaguely benevolent. A sudden
impulse came over the despondent student.
He would test the reality of this philanthropy.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Dr. Oldacre," said he,
rising from his chair; "I have a great favour
to ask of you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor's appearance was not encouraging.
His mouth suddenly tightened, and his
eyes fell.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Montgomery?"</p>

<p>"You are aware, sir, that I need only one
more session to complete my course."</p>

<p>"So you have told me."</p>

<p>"It is very important to me, sir."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"The fees, Dr. Oldacre, would amount to
about sixty pounds."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that my duties call me elsewhere,
Mr. Montgomery."</p>

<p>"One moment, sir! I had hoped, sir, that
perhaps, if I signed a paper promising you interest
upon your money, you would advance
this sum to me. I will pay you back, sir, I
really will. Or, if you like, I will work it off
after I am qualified."</p>

<p>The doctor's lips had thinned into a narrow
line. His eyes were raised again, and sparkled
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Your request is unreasonable, Mr. Montgomery.
I am surprised that you should have
made it. Consider, sir, how many thousands
of medical students there are in this country.
No doubt there are many of them who have a
difficulty in finding their fees. Am I to provide
for them all? Or why should I make an
exception in your favour? I am grieved and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
disappointed, Mr. Montgomery, that you
should have put me into the painful position of
having to refuse you." He turned upon his
heel, and walked with offended dignity out of
the surgery.</p>

<p>The student smiled bitterly, and turned to
his work of making up the morning prescriptions.
It was poor and unworthy work&mdash;work
which any weakling might have done as well,
and this was a man of exceptional nerve and
sinew. But, such as it was, it brought him his
board and &pound;1 a week, enough to help him
during the summer months and let him save a
few pounds towards his winter keep. But
those class fees! Where were they to come
from? He could not save them out of his
scanty wage. Dr. Oldacre would not advance
them. He saw no way of earning them. His
brains were fairly good, but brains of that
quality were a drug in the market. He
only excelled in his strength; and where was
he to find a customer for that? But the
ways of Fate are strange, and his customer was
at hand.</p>

<p>"Look y'ere!" said a voice at the door.</p>

<p>Montgomery looked up, for the voice was a
loud and rasping one. A young man stood at the
entrance&mdash;a stocky, bull-necked young miner,
in tweed Sunday clothes and an aggressive
necktie. He was a sinister-looking figure, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
dark, insolent eyes, and the jaw and throat of a
bulldog.</p>

<p>"Look y'ere!" said he again. "Why hast
thou not sent t' medicine oop as thy master ordered?"</p>

<p>Montgomery had become accustomed to the
brutal frankness of the Northern worker. At
first it had enraged him, but after a time he had
grown callous to it, and accepted it as it was
meant. But this was something different. It
was insolence&mdash;brutal, overbearing insolence,
with physical menace behind it.</p>

<p>"What name?" he asked coldly.</p>

<p>"Barton. Happen I may give thee cause to
mind that name, yoong man. Mak' oop t'
wife's medicine this very moment, look ye, or
it will be the worse for thee."</p>

<p>Montgomery smiled. A pleasant sense of
relief thrilled softly through him. What blessed
safety-valve was this through which his jangled
nerves might find some outlet. The provocation
was so gross, the insult so unprovoked,
that he could have none of those qualms which
take the edge off a man's mettle. He finished
sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied,
and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the
rack.</p>

<p>"Look here!" said he turning round to the
miner, "your medicine will be made up in its
turn and sent down to you. I don't allow folk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the surgery. Wait outside in the waiting-room,
if you wish to wait at all."</p>

<p>"Yoong man," said the miner, "thou's got
to mak' t' wife's medicine here, and now, and
quick, while I wait and watch thee, or else happen
thou might need some medicine thysel' before
all is over."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't advise you to fasten a quarrel
upon me." Montgomery was speaking in the
hard, staccato voice of a man who is holding
himself in with difficulty. "You'll save
trouble if you'll go quietly. If you don't
you'll be hurt. Ah, you would? Take it,
then!"</p>

<p>The blows were almost simultaneous&mdash;a savage
swing which whistled past Montgomery's
ear, and a straight drive which took the workman
on the chin. Luck was with the assistant.
That single whizzing uppercut, and the
way in which it was delivered, warned him that
he had a formidable man to deal with. But if
he had underrated his antagonist, his antagonist
had also underrated him, and had laid himself
open to a fatal blow.</p>

<p>The miner's head had come with a crash
against the corner of the surgery shelves, and
he had dropped heavily onto the ground. There
he lay with his bandy legs drawn up and his
hands thrown abroad, the blood trickling over
the surgery tiles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Had enough?" asked the assistant, breathing
fiercely through his nose.</p>

<p>But no answer came. The man was insensible.
And then the danger of his position came
upon Montgomery, and he turned as white as
his antagonist. A Sunday, the immaculate Dr.
Oldacre with his pious connection, a savage
brawl with a patient; he would irretrievably lose
his situation if the facts came out. It was not
much of a situation, but he could not get another
without a reference, and Oldacre might
refuse him one. Without money for his classes,
and without a situation&mdash;what was to become of
him? It was absolute ruin.</p>

<p>But perhaps he could escape exposure after
all. He seized his insensible adversary, dragged
him out into the centre of the room, loosened
his collar, and squeezed the surgery sponge
over his face. He sat up at last with a gasp
and a scowl.</p>

<p>"Domn thee, thou's spoilt my necktie," said
he, mopping up the water from his breast.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I hit you so hard," said Montgomery,
apologetically.</p>

<p>"Thou hit me hard! I could stan' such fly-flappin'
all day. 'Twas this here press that
cracked my pate for me, and thou art a looky
man to be able to boast as thou hast outed me.
And now I'd be obliged to thee if thou wilt give
me t' wife's medicine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Montgomery gladly made it up and handed
it to the miner.</p>

<p>"You are weak still," said he. "Won't you
stay awhile and rest?"</p>

<p>"T' wife wants her medicine," said the man,
and lurched out at the door.</p>

<p>The assistant, looking after him, saw him
rolling with an uncertain step down the street,
until a friend met him, and they walked on
arm-in-arm. The man seemed in his rough
Northern fashion to bear no grudge, and
so Montgomery's fears left him. There was
no reason why the doctor should know anything
about it. He wiped the blood from
the floor, put the surgery in order, and went
on with his interrupted task, hoping that he
had come scathless out of a very dangerous
business.</p>

<p>Yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague
uneasiness, which sharpened into dismay when,
late in the afternoon, he was informed that three
gentlemen had called and were waiting for him
in the surgery. A coroner's inquest, a descent
of detectives, an invasion of angry relatives&mdash;all
sorts of possibilities rose to scare him. With
tense nerves and a rigid face he went to meet
his visitors.</p>

<p>They were a very singular trio. Each was
known to him by sight; but what on earth the
three could be doing together, and, above all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
what they could expect from <i>him</i>, was a most
inexplicable problem.</p>

<p>The first was Sorley Wilson, the son of the
owner of the Nonpareil Coalpit. He was a
young blood of twenty, heir to a fortune, a
keen sportsman, and down for the Easter Vacation
from Magdalene College. He sat
now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking
in thoughtful silence at Montgomery, and
twisting the ends of his small, black, waxed
moustache.</p>

<p>The second was Purvis, the publican, owner
of the chief beershop, and well known as the
local bookmaker. He was a coarse, clean-shaven
man, whose fiery face made a singular contrast
with his ivory-white bald head. He had shrewd,
light-blue eyes with foxy lashes, and he also
leaned forward in silence from his chair, a fat,
red hand upon either knee, and stared critically
at the young assistant.</p>

<p>So did the third visitor, Fawcett, the horsebreaker,
who leaned back, his long, thin legs,
with their box-cloth riding-gaiters, thrust out in
front of him, tapping his protruding teeth with
his riding-whip, with anxious thought in every
line of his rugged, bony face. Publican, exquisite,
and horsebreaker were all three equally
silent, equally earnest, and equally critical.
Montgomery, seated in the midst of them,
looked from one to the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen?" he observed, but no
answer came.</p>

<p>The position was embarrassing.</p>

<p>"No," said the horsebreaker, at last. "No.
It's off. It's nowt."</p>

<p>"Stand oop, lad; let's see thee standin'." It
was the publican who spoke.</p>

<p>Montgomery obeyed. He would learn all
about it, no doubt, if he were patient. He stood
up and turned slowly round, as if in front of
his tailor.</p>

<p>"It's off! It's off!" cried the horsebreaker.
"Why, mon, the Master would break him over
his knee."</p>

<p>"Oh, that behanged for a yarn!" said the
young Cantab. "You can drop out if you like,
Fawcett, but I'll see this thing through, if I
have to do it alone. I don't hedge a penny. I
like the cut of him a great deal better than I
liked Ted Barton."</p>

<p>"Look at Barton's shoulders, Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>"Lumpiness isn't always strength. Give me
nerve and fire and breed. That's what wins."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, you have it theer&mdash;you have it
theer!" said the fat, red-faced publican, in a
thick, suety voice. "It's the same wi' poops.
Get 'em clean-bred an' fine, and they'll yark the
thick 'uns&mdash;yark 'em out o' their skins."</p>

<p>"He's ten good pund on the light side,"
growled the horsebreaker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a welter weight, anyhow."</p>

<p>"A hundred and thirty."</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty, if he's an ounce."</p>

<p>"Well, the master doesn't scale much more
than that."</p>

<p>"A hundred and seventy-five."</p>

<p>"That was when he was hog-fat and living
high. Work the grease out of him, and I lay
there's no great difference between them. Have
you been weighed lately, Mr. Montgomery?"</p>

<p>It was the first direct question which had
been asked him. He had stood in the midst
of them, like a horse at a fair, and he was just
beginning to wonder whether he was more
angry or amused.</p>

<p>"I am just eleven stone," said he.</p>

<p>"I said that he was a welter weight."</p>

<p>"But suppose you was trained?" said the
publican. "Wot then?"</p>

<p>"I am always in training."</p>

<p>"In a manner of speakin', do doubt, he <i>is</i>
always in trainin'," remarked the horsebreaker.
"But trainin' for everyday work ain't the same
as trainin' with a trainer; and I dare bet, with
all respec' to your opinion, Mr. Wilson, that
there's half a stone of tallow on him at this
minute."</p>

<p>The young Cantab put his fingers on the
assistant's upper arm. Then with his other
hand on his wrist he bent the forearm sharply,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and felt the biceps, as round and hard as a
cricket-ball, spring up under his fingers.</p>

<p>"Feel that!" said he.</p>

<p>The publican and horsebreaker felt it with
an air of reverence.</p>

<p>"Good lad! He'll do yet!" cried Purvis.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Montgomery," I think
that you will acknowledge that I have been
very patient with you. I have listened to all
that you have to say about my personal appearance,
and now I must really beg that you
will have the goodness to tell me what is the
matter."</p>

<p>They all sat down in their serious, businesslike
way.</p>

<p>"That's easy done, Mr. Montgomery," said
the fat-voiced publican. "But before sayin'
anything, we had to wait and see whether, in a
way of speakin', there was any need for us to
say anything at all. Mr. Wilson thinks there is.
Mr. Fawcett, who has the same right to his
opinion, bein' also a backer and one o' the
committee, thinks the other way."</p>

<p>"I thought him too light built, and I think
so now," said the horsebreaker, still tapping
his prominent teeth with the metal head of his
riding-whip. "But happen he may pull
through; and he's a fine-made, buirdly young
chap, so if you mean to back him, Mr. Wilson&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which I do."</p>

<p>"And you, Purvis?"</p>

<p>"I ain't one to go back, Fawcett."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll stan' to my share of the purse."</p>

<p>"And well I knew you would," said Purvis,
"for it would be somethin' new to find Isaac
Fawcett as a spoil-sport. Well, then, we make
up the hundred for the stake among us, and the
fight stands&mdash;always supposin' the young man
is willin'."</p>

<p>"Excuse all this rot, Mr. Montgomery,"
said the University man, in a genial voice.
"We've begun at the wrong end, I know, but
we'll soon straighten it out, and I hope that
you will see your way to falling in with our
views. In the first place, you remember the
man whom you knocked out this morning?
He is Barton&mdash;the famous Ted Barton."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir, you may well be proud to
have outed him in one round," said the publican.
"Why, it took Morris, the ten-stone-six
champion, a deal more trouble than that before
he put Barton to sleep. You've done a fine
performance, sir, and happen you'll do a finer,
if you give yourself the chance."</p>

<p>"I never heard of Ted Barton, beyond seeing
the name on a medicine label," said the assistant.</p>

<p>"Well, you may take it from me that he's a
slaughterer," said the horsebreaker. "You've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
taught him a lesson that he needed, for it was
always a word and a blow with him, and the
word alone was worth five shillin' in a public
court. He won't be so ready now to shake
his nief in the face of everyone he meets.
However, that's neither here nor there."</p>

<p>Montgomery looked at them in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"For goodness sake, gentlemen, tell me what
it is you want me to do!" he cried.</p>

<p>"We want you to fight Silas Craggs, better
known as the Master of Croxley."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because Ted Barton was to have fought
him next Saturday. He was the champion of
the Wilson coal-pits, and the other was the
Master of the iron-folk down at the Croxley
smelters. We'd matched our man for a purse
of a hundred against the Master. But you've
queered our man, and he can't face such a battle
with a two-inch cut at the back of his head.
There's only one thing to be done, sir, and that
is for you to take his place. If you can lick
Ted Barton you may lick the Master of Croxley;
but if you don't we're done, for there's no
one else who is in the same street with him
in this district. It's twenty rounds, two-ounce
gloves, Queensberry rules, and a decision on
points if you fight to the finish."</p>

<p>For a moment the absurdity of the thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
drove every other thought out of Montgomery's
head. But then there came a sudden revulsion.
A hundred pounds!&mdash;all he wanted to complete
his education was lying there ready to his
hand, if only that hand were strong enough to
pick it up. He had thought bitterly that
morning that there was no market for his
strength, but here was one where his muscle
might earn more in an hour than his brains in a
year. But a chill of doubt came over him.</p>

<p>"How can I fight for the coal-pits?" said
he. "I am not connected with them."</p>

<p>"Eh, lad, but thou art!" cried old Purvis.
"We've got it down in writin', and it's clear
enough. 'Any one connected with the coal-pits.'
Doctor Oldacre is the coal-pit club doctor;
thou art his assistant. What more can
they want?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right enough," said the Cantab.
"It would be a very sporting thing of you, Mr.
Montgomery, if you would come to our help
when we are in such a hole. Of course, you
might not like to take the hundred pounds;
but I have no doubt that, in the case of your
winning, we could arrange that it should take
the form of a watch or piece of plate, or any
other shape which might suggest itself to you.
You see, you are responsible for our having
lost our champion, so we really feel that we
have a claim upon you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me a moment, gentlemen. It is very
unexpected. I am afraid the doctor would never
consent to my going&mdash;in fact, I am sure that
he would not."</p>

<p>"But he need never know&mdash;not before the
fight, at any rate. We are not bound to give
the name of our man. So long as he is within
the weight limits on the day of the fight, that is
all that concerns any one."</p>

<p>The adventure and the profit would either of
them have attracted Montgomery. The two
combined were irresistible.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I'll do it!"</p>

<p>The three sprang from their seats. The
publican had seized his right hand, the horse-dealer
his left, and the Cantab slapped him on
the back.</p>

<p>"Good lad! good lad!" croaked the publican.
"Eh, mon, but if thou yark him, thou'll
rise in one day from being just a common doctor
to the best-known mon 'twixt here and
Bradford. Thou art a witherin' tyke, thou art,
and no mistake; and if thou beat the Master
of Croxley, thou'll find all the beer thou want
for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the
Four Sacks."</p>

<p>"It is the most sporting thing I ever heard
of in my life," said young Wilson. "By
George, sir, if you pull it off, you've got the
constituency in your pocket, if you care to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stand. You know the outhouse in my garden?"</p>

<p>"Next the road?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I turned it into a gymnasium
for Ted Barton. You'll find all you want
there: clubs, punching ball, bars, dumb-bells,
everything. Then you'll want a sparring partner.
Ogilvy has been acting for Barton, but
we don't think that he is class enough. Barton
bears you no grudge. He's a good-hearted
fellow, though cross-grained with strangers.
He looked upon you as a stranger this morning,
but he says he knows you now. He is
quite ready to spar with you for practice, and
he will come at any hour you will name."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will let you know the hour,"
said Montgomery; and so the committee departed
jubilant upon their way.</p>

<p>The medical assistant sat for a little time in
the surgery turning it over in his mind. He
had been trained originally at the University by
the man who had been middle-weight champion
in his day. It was true that his teacher was
long past his prime, slow upon his feet and
stiff in his joints, but even so he was still a
tough antagonist; but Montgomery had found
at last that he could more than hold his own
with him. He had won the University medal,
and his teacher, who had trained so many students,
was emphatic in his opinion that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
never had one who was in the same class with
him. He had been exhorted to go in for the
Amateur Championships, but he had no particular
ambition in that direction. Once he had
put on the gloves with Hammer Tunstall in
a booth at a fair, and had fought three rattling
rounds, in which he had the worst of it, but
had made the prize-fighter stretch himself to
the uttermost. There was his whole record, and
was it enough to encourage him to stand up to
the Master of Croxley? He had never heard of
the Master before, but then he had lost touch
of the ring during the last few years of hard
work. After all, what did it matter? If he
won, there was the money, which meant so
much to him. If he lost, it would only mean
a thrashing. He could take punishment without
flinching, of that he was certain. If there
were only one chance in a hundred of pulling
it off, then it was worth his while to attempt it.</p>

<p>Dr. Oldacre, new come from church, with an
ostentatious Prayer-book in his kid-gloved
hand, broke in upon his meditation.</p>

<p>"You don't go to service, I observe, Mr.
Montgomery," said he, coldly.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I have had some business to detain
me."</p>

<p>"It is very near to my heart that my household
should set a good example. There are so
few educated people in this district that a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
responsibility devolves upon us. If we do not
live up to the highest, how can we expect these
poor workers to do so? It is a dreadful thing
to reflect that the parish takes a great deal more
interest in an approaching glove-fight than in
their religious duties."</p>

<p>"A glove-fight, sir?" said Montgomery,
guiltily.</p>

<p>"I believe that to be the correct term. One
of my patients tells me that it is the talk of the
district. A local ruffian, a patient of ours, by
the way, is matched against a pugilist over at
Croxley. I cannot understand why the law does
not step in and stop so degrading an exhibition.
It is really a prize-fight."</p>

<p>"A glove fight, you said."</p>

<p>"I am informed that a two-ounce glove is
an evasion by which they dodge the law, and
make it difficult for the police to interfere.
They contend for a sum of money. It seems
dreadful and almost incredible&mdash;does it not?&mdash;to
think that such scenes can be enacted within
a few miles of our peaceful home. But you
will realize, Mr. Montgomery, that while there
are such influences for us to counteract, it is
very necessary that we should live up to our
highest."</p>

<p>The doctor's sermon would have had more effect
if the assistant had not once or twice had
occasion to test his highest and come upon it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at unexpectedly humble elevations. It is always
so particularly easy to "compound for
sins we're most inclined to by damning those
we have no mind to." In any case, Montgomery
felt that of all the men concerned in such a
fight&mdash;promoters, backers, spectators&mdash;it is the
actual fighter who holds the strongest and most
honourable position. His conscience gave him
no concern upon the subject. Endurance and
courage are virtues, not vices, and brutality is,
at least, better than effeminacy.</p>

<p>There was a little tobacco-shop at the corner
of the street, where Montgomery got his bird's-eye
and also his local information, for the shopman
was a garrulous soul, who knew everything
about the affairs of the district. The
assistant strolled down there after tea and
asked, in a casual way, whether the tobacconist
had ever heard of the Master of Croxley.</p>

<p>"Heard of him! Heard of him!" the
little man could hardly articulate in his astonishment.
"Why, sir, he's the first mon o' the
district, an' his name's as well known in the
West Riding as the winner o' t' Derby. But
Lor', sir"&mdash;here he stopped and rummaged
among a heap of papers. "They are makin' a
fuss about him on account o' his fight wi' Ted
Barton, and so the <i>Croxley Herald</i> has his life
an' record, an' here it is, an' thou canst read it
for thysel'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The sheet of the paper which he held up was a
lake of print around an islet of illustration.
The latter was a coarse wood-cut of a pugilist's
head and neck set in a cross-barred jersey. It
was a sinister but powerful face, the face of a
debauched hero, clean-shaven, strongly eyebrowed,
keen-eyed, with a huge aggressive jaw
and an animal dewlap beneath it. The long,
obstinate cheeks ran flush up to the narrow,
sinister eyes. The mighty neck came down
square from the ears and curved outwards into
shoulders, which had lost nothing at the hands
of the local artist. Above was written "Silas
Craggs," and beneath, "The Master of Croxley."</p>

<p>"Thou'll find all about him there, sir," said
the tobacconist. "He's a witherin' tyke, he
is, and we're proud to have him in the county.
If he hadn't broke his leg he'd have been
champion of England."</p>

<p>"Broke his leg, has he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it set badly. They ca' him owd
K behind his bock, for thot is how his two
legs look. But his arms&mdash;well, if they was
both stropped to a bench, as the sayin' is, I
wonder where the champion of England would
be then."</p>

<p>"I'll take this with me," said Montgomery;
and putting the paper into his pocket he returned
home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not a cheering record which he read
there. The whole history of the Croxley
Master was given in full, his many victories,
his few defeats.</p>

<p>"Born in 1857," said the provincial biographer,
"Silas Craggs, better known in sporting
circles as The Master of Croxley, is now
in his fortieth year."</p>

<p>"Hang it, I'm only twenty-three," said
Montgomery to himself, and read on more
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Having in his youth shown a surprising
aptitude for the game, he fought his way up
among his comrades, until he became the
recognized champion of the district and won
the proud title which he still holds. Ambitious
of a more than local fame, he secured a patron,
and fought his first fight against Jack Barton,
of Birmingham, in May, 1880, at the old
Loiterers' Club. Craggs, who fought at ten-stone-two
at the time, had the better of fifteen
rattling rounds, and gained an award on points
against the Midlander. Having disposed of
James Dunn, of Rotherhithe, Cameron, of
Glasgow, and a youth named Fernie, he was
thought so highly of by the fancy that he was
matched against Ernest Willox, at that time
middle-weight champion of the North of England,
and defeated him in a hard-fought battle,
knocking him out in the tenth round after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
punishing contest. At this period it looked as
if the very highest honours of the ring were
within the reach of the young Yorkshireman,
but he was laid upon the shelf by a most unfortunate
accident. The kick of a horse broke
his thigh, and for a year he was compelled to
rest himself. When he returned to his work
the fracture had set badly, and his activity was
much impaired. It was owing to this that he
was defeated in seven rounds by Willox, the
man whom he had previously beaten, and afterwards
by James Shaw, of London, though the
latter acknowledged that he had found the
toughest customer of his career. Undismayed
by his reverses, the Master adapted the style
of his fighting to his physical disabilities and
resumed his career of victory&mdash;defeating Norton
(the black), Bobby Wilson, and Levy Cohen,
the latter a heavy-weight. Conceding two
stone, he fought a draw with the famous Billy
McQuire, and afterwards, for a purse of fifty
pounds, he defeated Sam Hare at the Pelican
Club, London. In 1891 a decision was given
against him upon a foul when fighting a winning
fight against Jim Taylor, the Australian middle-weight,
and so mortified was he by the decision,
that he withdrew from the ring. Since then
he has hardly fought at all save to accommodate
any local aspirant who may wish to learn the
difference between a bar-room scramble and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
scientific contest. The latest of these ambitious
souls comes from the Wilson coal-pits, which
have undertaken to put up a stake of &pound;100
and back their local champion. There are
various rumours afloat as to who their representative
is to be, the name of Ted Barton being
freely mentioned; but the betting, which is
seven to one on the Master against any untried
man, is a fair reflection of the feeling of the
community."</p>

<p>Montgomery read it over twice, and it left
him with a very serious face. No light matter
this which he had undertaken; no battle with a
rough-and-tumble fighter who presumed upon
a local reputation. The man's record showed
that he was first-class&mdash;or nearly so. There
were a few points in his favour, and he must
make the most of them. There was age&mdash;twenty-three
against forty. There was an old
ring proverb that "Youth will be served," but
the annals of the ring offer a great number of
exceptions. A hard veteran, full of cool valour
and ring-craft, could give ten or fifteen years
and a beating to most striplings. He could not
rely too much upon his advantage in age. But
then there was the lameness; that must surely
count for a great deal. And, lastly, there was
the chance that the Master might underrate his
opponent, that he might be remiss in his training,
and refuse to abandon his usual way of life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
if he thought that he had an easy task before
him. In a man of his age and habits this seemed
very possible. Montgomery prayed that it
might be so. Meanwhile, if his opponent were
the best man who ever jumped the ropes into a
ring, his own duty was clear. He must prepare
himself carefully, throw away no chance, and do
the very best that he could. But he knew
enough to appreciate the difference which exists
in boxing, as in every sport, between the amateur
and the professional. The coolness, the
power of hitting, above all the capability of taking
punishment, count for so much. Those
specially developed, gutta-percha-like abdominal
muscles of the hardened pugilist will take
without flinching a blow which would leave another
man writhing on the ground. Such things
are not to be acquired in a week, but all that
could be done in a week should be done.</p>

<p>The medical assistant had a good basis to
start from. He was 5 feet 11 inches&mdash;tall
enough for anything on two legs, as the old ring
men used to say&mdash;lithe and spare, with the activity
of a panther, and a strength which had
hardly yet ever found its limitations. His muscular
development was finely hard, but his power
came rather from that higher nerve-energy
which counts for nothing upon a measuring tape.
He had the well-curved nose, and the widely-opened
eye which never yet were seen upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
face of a craven, and behind everything he had
the driving force, which came from the knowledge
that his whole career was at stake upon the
contest. The three backers rubbed their hands
when they saw him at work punching the ball
in the gymnasium next morning; and Fawcett,
the horsebreaker, who had written to Leeds to
hedge his bets, sent a wire to cancel the letter,
and to lay another fifty at the market price of
seven to one.</p>

<p>Montgomery's chief difficulty was to find
time for his training without any interference
from the doctor. His work took him a large
part of the day, but as the visiting was done on
foot, and considerable distances had to be traversed,
it was a training in itself. For the rest,
he punched the swinging ball and worked with
the dumb-bells for an hour every morning and
evening, and boxed twice a day with Ted Barton
in the gymnasium, gaining as much profit
as could be got from a rushing, two-handed
slogger. Barton was full of admiration for his
cleverness and quickness, but doubtful about
his strength. Hard hitting was the feature of
his own style, and he exacted it from others.</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, that's a turble poor poonch for
an eleven-stone man!" he would cry. "Thou
wilt have to hit harder than that afore t' Master
will know that thou art theer. Ah, thot's
better, mon, thot's fine!" he would add, as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
opponent lifted him across the room on the
end of a right counter. "Thot's how I likes
to feel 'em. Happen thou'lt pull through yet."
He chuckled with joy when Montgomery
knocked him into a corner. "Eh, mon, thou
art comin' along grand. Thou hast fair
yarked me off my legs. Do it again, lad, do it
again!"</p>

<p>The only part of Montgomery's training
which came within the doctor's observation was
his diet, and that puzzled him considerably.</p>

<p>"You will excuse my remarking, Mr. Montgomery,
that you are becoming rather particular
in your tastes. Such fads are not to be encouraged
in one's youth. Why do you eat
toast with every meal?"</p>

<p>"I find that it suits me better than bread,
sir."</p>

<p>"It entails unnecessary work upon the cook.
I observe, also, that you have turned against
potatoes."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I think that I am better without
them."</p>

<p>"And you no longer drink your beer?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"These causeless whims and fancies are very
much to be deprecated, Mr. Montgomery.
Consider how many there are to whom these
very potatoes and this very beer would be most
acceptable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt, sir. But at present I prefer to
do without them."</p>

<p>They were sitting alone at lunch, and the
assistant thought that it would be a good opportunity
of asking leave for the day of the
fight.</p>

<p>"I should be glad if you could let me have
leave for Saturday, Doctor Oldacre."</p>

<p>"It is very inconvenient upon so busy a
day."</p>

<p>"I should do a double day's work on Friday
so as to leave everything in order. I should
hope to be back in the evening."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot spare you, Mr. Montgomery."</p>

<p>This was a facer. If he could not get leave
he would go without it.</p>

<p>"You will remember, Doctor Oldacre, that
when I came to you it was understood that I
should have a clear day every month. I have
never claimed one. But now there are reasons
why I wish to have a holiday upon Saturday."</p>

<p>Doctor Oldacre gave in with a very bad
grace.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you insist upon your formal
rights, there is no more to be said, Mr. Montgomery,
though I feel that it shows a certain
indifference to my comfort and the welfare of
the practice. Do you still insist?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good. Have your way."</p>

<p>The doctor was boiling over with anger, but
Montgomery was a valuable assistant&mdash;steady,
capable, and hard-working&mdash;and he could not
afford to lose him. Even if he had been
prompted to advance those class fees, for which
his assistant had appealed, it would have been
against his interests to do so, for he did not
wish him to qualify, and he desired him to
remain in his subordinate position, in which he
worked so hard for so small a wage. There
was something in the cool insistence of the
young man, a quiet resolution in his voice as
he claimed his Saturday, which aroused his
curiosity.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to interfere unduly with
your affairs, Mr. Montgomery, but were you
thinking of having a day in Leeds upon
Saturday?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"In the country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You are very wise. You will find a quiet
day among the wild flowers a very valuable
restorative. Had you thought of any particular
direction?"</p>

<p>"I am going over Croxley way."</p>

<p>"Well, there is no prettier country when
once you are past the iron-works. What could
be more delightful than to lie upon the Fells,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
basking in the sunshine, with perhaps some
instructive and elevating book as your companion?
I should recommend a visit to the
ruins of St. Bridget's Church, a very interesting
relic of the early Norman era. By the way,
there is one objection which I see to your going
to Croxley on Saturday. It is upon that date,
as I am informed, that that ruffianly glove-fight
takes place. You may find yourself molested
by the blackguards whom it will attract."</p>

<p>"I will take my chance of that, sir," said the
assistant.</p>

<p>On the Friday night, which was the last
before the fight, Montgomery's three backers
assembled in the gymnasium and inspected
their man as he went through some light
exercises to keep his muscles supple. He was
certainly in splendid condition, his skin shining
with health, and his eyes with energy and confidence.
The three walked round him and
exulted.</p>

<p>"He's simply ripping!" said the undergraduate.
"By gad, you've come out of it
splendidly. You're as hard as a pebble, and
fit to fight for your life."</p>

<p>"Happen he's a trifle on the fine side," said
the publican. "Runs a bit light at the loins,
to my way of thinkin'."</p>

<p>"What weight to-day?"</p>

<p>"Ten stone eleven," the assistant answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's only three pund off in a week's
trainin'," said the horsebreaker. "He said
right when he said that he was in condition.
Well, it's fine stuff all there is of it, but I'm
none so sure as there is enough." He kept
poking his finger into Montgomery, as if he
were one of his horses. "I hear that the
Master will scale a hundred and sixty odd at
the ring-side."</p>

<p>"But there's some of that which he'd like
well to pull off and leave behind wi' his shirt,"
said Purvis. "I hear they've had a rare job
to get him to drop his beer, and if it had not
been for that great red-headed wench of his
they'd never ha' done it. She fair scratted the
face off a potman that had brought him a
gallon from t' Chequers. They say the hussy
is his sparrin' partner, as well as his sweetheart,
and that his poor wife is just breakin' her heart
over it. Hullo, young 'un, what do you want?"</p>

<p>The door of the gymnasium had opened,
and a lad about sixteen, grimy and black with
soot and iron, stepped into the yellow glare of
the oil-lamp. Ted Barton seized him by the
collar.</p>

<p>"See here, thou yoong whelp, this is private,
and we want noan o' thy spyin'!"</p>

<p>"But I maun speak to Mr. Wilson."</p>

<p>The young Cantab stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, what is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's aboot t' fight, Mr. Wilson, sir. I
wanted to tell your mon somethin' aboot t'
Maister."</p>

<p>"We've no time to listen to gossip, my boy.
We know all about the Master."</p>

<p>"But thou doant, sir. Nobody knows but
me and mother, and we thought as we'd like
thy mon to know, sir, for we want him to fair
bray him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want the Master fair brayed, do
you? So do we. Well, what have you to
say?"</p>

<p>"Is this your mon, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, suppose it is?"</p>

<p>"Then it's him I want to tell aboot it. T'
Maister is blind o' the left eye."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It's true, sir. Not stone blind, but rarely
fogged. He keeps it secret, but mother knows,
and so do I. If thou slip him on the left side
he can't cop thee. Thou'll find it right as I
tell thee. And mark him when he sinks his
right. 'Tis his best blow, his right upper-cut.
T' Maister's finisher, they ca' it at t' works.
It's a turble blow, when it do come home."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my boy. This is information
worth having about his sight," said Wilson.
"How came you to know so much? Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm his son, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson whistled.</p>

<p>"And who sent you to us?"</p>

<p>"My mother. I maun get back to her
again."</p>

<p>"Take this half-crown."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't seek money in comin' here.
I do it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For love?" suggested the publican.</p>

<p>"For hate!" said the boy, and darted off
into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Seems to me t' red-headed wench may do
him more harm than good, after all," remarked
the publican. "And now," Mr. Montgomery,
sir, you&acute;ve done enough for this evenin', an' a
nine hours' sleep is the best trainin' before a
battle. Happen this time to-morrow night
you'll be safe back again with your &pound;100 in
your pocket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>II</h2>

<p class="cap">WORK was struck at one o'clock at the coal-pits
and the iron-works, and the fight
was arranged for three. From the Croxley
Furnaces, from Wilson's Coal-pits, from the
Heartsease Mine, from the Dodd Mills, from
the Leverworth Smelters the workmen came
trooping, each with his fox-terrier or his lurcher
at his heels. Warped with labour and twisted
by toil, bent double by week-long work in the
cramped coal galleries, or half-blinded with years
spent in front of white-hot fluid metal, these
men still gilded their harsh and hopeless lives
by their devotion to sport. It was their one relief,
the only thing which could distract their
mind from sordid surroundings, and give them
an interest beyond the blackened circle which
inclosed them. Literature, art, science, all these
things were beyond the horizon; but the race,
the football match, the cricket, the fight, these
were things which they could understand, which
they could speculate upon in advance and comment
upon afterwards. Sometimes brutal, sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
grotesque, the love of sport is still one of
the great agencies which make for the happiness
of our people. It lies very deeply in the
springs of our nature, and when it has been educated
out, a higher, more refined nature may be
left, but it will not be of that robust British
type which has left its mark so deeply on the
world. Every one of these ruddled workers,
slouching with his dog at his heels to see something
of the fight, was a true unit of his race.</p>

<p>It was a squally May day, with bright sun-bursts
and driving showers. Montgomery
worked all morning in the surgery getting his
medicine made up.</p>

<p>"The weather seems so very unsettled, Mr.
Montgomery," remarked the doctor, "that I
am inclined to think that you had better postpone
your little country excursion until a later
date."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I must go to-day, sir."</p>

<p>"I have just had an intimation that Mrs.
Potter, at the other side of Angleton, wishes to
see me. It is probable that I shall be there all
day. It will be extremely inconvenient to leave
the house empty so long."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, sir, but I must go," said
the assistant, doggedly.</p>

<p>The doctor saw that it would be useless to
argue, and departed in the worst of bad tempers
upon his mission. Montgomery felt easier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
now that he was gone. He went up to his
room, and packed his running-shoes, his fighting-drawers,
and his cricket-sash into a handbag.
When he came down Mr. Wilson was waiting
for him in the surgery.</p>

<p>"I hear the doctor has gone."</p>

<p>"Yes; he is likely to be away all day."</p>

<p>"I don't see that it matters much. It's
bound to come to his ears by to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes; it's serious with me, Mr. Wilson. If
I win, it's all right. I don't mind telling you
that the hundred pounds will make all the difference
to me. But if I lose, I shall lose my
situation, for, as you say, I can't keep it secret."</p>

<p>"Never mind. We'll see you through
among us. I only wonder the doctor has not
heard, for it's all over the country that you are
to fight the Croxley Champion. We've had
Armitage up about it already. He's the Master's
backer, you know. He wasn't sure that
you were eligible. The Master said he wanted
you whether you were eligible or not. Armitage
has money on, and would have made
trouble if he could. But I showed him that you
came within the conditions of the challenge, and
he agreed that it was all right. They think they
have a soft thing on."</p>

<p>"Well, I can only do my best," said Montgomery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>They lunched together; a silent and rather
nervous repast, for Montgomery's mind was
full of what was before him, and Wilson had
himself more money at stake than he cared to
lose.</p>

<p>Wilson's carriage and pair were at the door,
the horses with blue-and-white rosettes at their
ears, which were the colours of the Wilson Coal-pits,
well known on many a football field. At
the avenue gate a crowd of some hundred pit-men
and their wives gave a cheer as the carriage
passed. To the assistant it all seemed
dream-like and extraordinary&mdash;the strangest
experience of his life, but with a thrill of human
action and interest in it which made it passionately
absorbing. He lay back in the open
carriage and saw the fluttering handkerchiefs
from the doors and windows of the miners'
cottages. Wilson had pinned a blue-and-white
rosette upon his coat, and every one knew him
as their champion. "Good luck, sir! good
luck to thee!" they shouted from the roadside.
He felt that it was like some unromantic knight
riding down to sordid lists, but there was something
of chivalry in it all the same. He fought
for others as well as for himself. He might
fail from want of skill or strength, but deep in
his sombre soul he vowed that it should never
be for want of heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett was just mounting into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
high-wheeled, spidery dogcart, with his little
bit of blood between the shafts. He waved
his whip and fell in behind the carriage. They
overtook Purvis, the tomato-faced publican,
upon the road, with his wife in her Sunday
bonnet. They also dropped into the procession,
and then, as they traversed the seven
miles of the high-road to Croxley, their two-horsed,
rosetted carriage became gradually the
nucleus of a comet with a loosely radiating
tail. From every side-road came the miners'
carts, the humble, ramshackle traps, black and
bulging, with their loads of noisy, foul-tongued,
open-hearted partisans. They trailed
for a long quarter of a mile behind them&mdash;cracking,
whipping, shouting, galloping, swearing.
Horsemen and runners were mixed with
the vehicles. And then suddenly a squad of
the Sheffield Yeomanry, who were having
their annual training in those parts, clattered
and jingled out of a field, and rode as an escort
to the carriage. Through the dust-clouds
round him Montgomery saw the gleaming
brass helmets, the bright coats, and the tossing
heads of the chargers, the delighted brown
faces of the troopers. It was more dream-like
than ever.</p>

<p>And then, as they approached the monstrous,
uncouth line of bottle-shaped buildings
which marked the smelting-works of Croxley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
their long, writhing snake of dust was headed
off by another but longer one which wound
across their path. The main-road into which
their own opened was filled by the rushing current
of traps. The Wilson contingent halted
until the others should get past. The iron-men
cheered and groaned, according to their
humour, as they whirled past their antagonist.
Rough chaff flew back and forwards like iron
nuts and splinters of coal. "Brought him up,
then!" "Got t' hearse for to fetch him back?"
"Where's t' owd K-legs?" "Mon, mon,
have thy photograph took&mdash;'twill mind thee
of what thou used to look!" "He fight?&mdash;he's
now't but a half-baked doctor!" "Happen
he'll doctor thy Croxley Champion afore
he's through wi't."</p>

<p>So they flashed at each other as the one side
waited and the other passed. Then there came
a rolling murmur swelling into a shout, and a
great break with four horses came clattering
along, all streaming with salmon-pink ribbons.
The driver wore a white hat with pink rosette,
and beside him, on the high seat, were a man
and a woman&mdash;she with her arm round his
waist. Montgomery had one glimpse of them
as they flashed past: he with a furry cap drawn
low over his brow, a great frieze coat, and a
pink comforter round his throat; she brazen,
red-headed, bright-coloured, laughing excitedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
The Master, for it was he, turned as he passed,
gazed hard at Montgomery, and gave him a
menacing, gap-toothed grin. It was a hard,
wicked face, blue-jowled and craggy, with long,
obstinate cheeks and inexorable eyes. The
break behind was full of patrons of the sport&mdash;flushed
iron-foremen, heads of departments,
managers. One was drinking from a metal
flask, and raised it to Montgomery as he passed;
and then the crowd thinned, and the Wilson
<i>cort&egrave;ge</i> with their dragoons swept in at the rear
of the others.</p>

<p>The road led away from Croxley, between
curving green hills, gashed and polluted by the
searchers for coal and iron. The whole country
had been gutted, and vast piles of refuse and
mountains of slag suggested the mighty chambers
which the labor of man had burrowed
beneath. On the left the road curved up to
where a huge building, roofless and dismantled,
stood crumbling and forlorn, with the light
shining through the windowless squares.</p>

<p>"That's the old Arrowsmith's factory. That's
where the fight is to be," said Wilson. "How
are you feeling now?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. I was never better in my
life," Montgomery answered.</p>

<p>"By Gad, I like your nerve!" said Wilson,
who was himself flushed and uneasy. "You'll
give us a fight for our money, come what may.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
That place on the right is the office, and that
has been set aside as the dressing and weighing-room."</p>

<p>The carriage drove up to it amidst the shouts
of the folk upon the hillside. Lines of empty
carriages and traps curved down upon the
winding road, and a black crowd surged
round the door of the ruined factory. The
seats, as a huge placard announced, were five
shillings, three shillings, and a shilling, with
half-price for dogs. The takings, deducting
expenses, were to go to the winner, and it
was already evident that a larger stake than
a hundred pounds was in question. A babel
of voices rose from the door. The workers
wished to bring their dogs in free. The
men scuffled. The dogs barked. The crowd
was a whirling, eddying pool surging with a
roar up to the narrow cleft which was its only
outlet.</p>

<p>The break, with its salmon-coloured streamers
and four reeking horses, stood empty before
the door of the office; Wilson, Purvis, Fawcett,
and Montgomery passed in.</p>

<p>There was a large, bare room inside with
square, clean patches upon the grimy walls,
where pictures and almanacs had once hung.
Worn linoleum covered the floor, but there
was no furniture save some benches and a deal
table with a ewer and a basin upon it. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the corners were curtained off. In the
middle of the room was a weighing-chair. A
hugely fat man, with a salmon tie and a blue
waist-coat with bird's-eye spots, came bustling
up to them. It was Armitage, the butcher and
grazier, well known for miles round as a warm
man, and the most liberal patron of sport in
the Riding.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he grunted, in a thick, fussy,
wheezy voice, "you have come, then. Got
your man? Got your man?"</p>

<p>"Here he is, fit and well. Mr. Montgomery,
let me present you to Mr. Armitage."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, sir. Happy to make
your acquaintance. I make bold to say, sir,
that we of Croxley admire your courage, Mr.
Montgomery, and that our only hope is a fair
fight and no favour and the best man win.
That's our sentiment at Croxley."</p>

<p>"And it is my sentiment also," said the
assistant.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't say fairer than that, Mr.
Montgomery. You've taken a large contrac'
in hand, but a large contrac' may be carried
through, sir, as any one that knows my dealings
could testify. The Master is ready to
weigh in!"</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"You must weigh in the buff."</p>

<p>Montgomery looked askance at the tall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
red-headed woman who was standing gazing
out of the window.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Wilson. "Get
behind the curtain and put on your fighting-kit."</p>

<p>He did so, and came out the picture of an
athlete, in white, loose drawers, canvas shoes,
and the sash of a well-known cricket club
round his waist. He was trained to a hair, his
skin gleaming like silk, and every muscle
rippling down his broad shoulders and along
his beautiful arms as he moved them. They
bunched into ivory knobs, or slid into long,
sinuous curves, as he raised or lowered his
hands.</p>

<p>"What thinkest thou o' that?" asked Ted
Barton, his second, of the woman in the window.</p>

<p>She glanced contemptuously at the young
athlete.</p>

<p>"It's but a poor kindness thou dost him to
put a thread-paper yoong gentleman like yon
against a mon as is a mon. Why, my Jock
would throttle him wi' one hond lashed behind
him."</p>

<p>"Happen he may&mdash;happen not," said Barton.
"I have but twa pund in the world,
but it's on him, every penny, and no hedgin'.
But here's t' Maister, and rarely fine he do
look."</p>

<p>The prize-fighter had come out from his curtain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a squat, formidable figure, monstrous in
chest and arms, limping slightly on his distorted leg.
His skin had none of the freshness
and clearness of Montgomery's, but was dusky
and mottled, with one huge mole amid the mat
of tangled black hair which thatched his mighty
breast. His weight bore no relation to his
strength, for those huge shoulders and great
arms, with brown, sledge-hammer fists, would
have fitted the heaviest man that ever threw his
cap into a ring. But his loins and legs were
slight in proportion. Montgomery, on the
other hand, was as symmetrical as a Greek
statue. It would be an encounter between a
man who was specially fitted for one sport, and
one who was equally capable of any. The two
looked curiously at each other: a bulldog, and
a high-bred, clean-limbed terrier, each full of
spirit.</p>

<p>"How do you do?"</p>

<p>"How do?" The Master grinned again,
and his three jagged front teeth gleamed for an
instant. The rest had been beaten out of him
in twenty years of battle. He spat upon the
floor. "We have a rare fine day for't."</p>

<p>"Capital," said Montgomery.</p>

<p>"That's the good feelin' I like," wheezed the
fat butcher. "Good lads, both of them!&mdash;prime
lads!&mdash;hard meat an' good bone.
There's no ill-feelin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he downs me, Gawd bless him!" said
the Master.</p>

<p>"An' if we down him, Gawd help him!"
interrupted the woman.</p>

<p>"Haud thy tongue, wench!" said the Master,
impatiently. "Who art thou to put in
thy word? Happen I might draw my hand
across thy face."</p>

<p>The woman did not take the threat amiss.</p>

<p>"Wilt have enough for thy hand to do,
Jock," said she. "Get quit o' this gradely
man afore thou turn on me."</p>

<p>The lovers' quarrel was interrupted by the
entrance of a new comer, a gentleman with a
fur-collared overcoat and a very shiny top-hat&mdash;a
top-hat of a degree of glossiness which is
seldom seen five miles from Hyde Park. This
hat he wore at the extreme back of his head, so
that the lower surface of the brim made a kind
of frame for his high, bald forehead, his keen
eyes, his rugged and yet kindly face. He
bustled in with the quiet air of possession with
which the ring-master enters the circus.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Stapleton, the referee from London,"
said Wilson.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Stapleton? I was
introduced to you at the big fight at the Corinthian
Club, in Piccadilly."</p>

<p>"Ah, I dare say," said the other, shaking
hands. "Fact is, I'm introduced to so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that I can't undertake to carry their names.
Wilson, is it? Well, Mr. Wilson, glad to see
you. Couldn't get a fly at the station, and
that's why I'm late."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir," said Armitage, "we should
be proud that any one so well known in the boxing
world should come down to our little exhibition."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Not at all. Anything in the
interests of boxin'. All ready? Men weighed?"</p>

<p>"Weighing now, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, just as well I should see it done. Seen
you before, Craggs. Saw you fight your second
battle against Willox. You had beaten
him once, but he came back on you. What
does the indicator say?&mdash;one hundred and
sixty-three pounds&mdash;two off for the kit&mdash;one
hundred and sixty-one. Now, my lad, you
jump. My goodness, what colours are you
wearing?"</p>

<p>"The Anonymi Cricket Club."</p>

<p>"What right have you to wear them? I belong
to the club myself."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"You an amateur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you are fighting for a money prize?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what you are doing?
You realize that you're a professional pug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from this onwards, and that if ever you fight
again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll never fight again."</p>

<p>"Happen you won't," said the woman, and
the Master turned a terrible eye upon her.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you know your own business
best. Up you jump. One hundred and fifty-one,
minus two, one hundred and forty-nine&mdash;twelve
pounds difference, but youth and condition
on the other scale. Well, the sooner we
get to work the better, for I wish to catch the
seven o'clock express at Hellifield. Twenty
three-minute rounds, with one-minute intervals,
and Queensberry rules. Those are the conditions,
are they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good, then, we may go across."</p>

<p>The two combatants had overcoats thrown
over their shoulders, and the whole party, backers,
fighters, seconds, and the referee, filed out
of the room. A police inspector was waiting
for them in the road. He had a notebook in
his hand&mdash;that terrible weapon which awes even
the London cabman.</p>

<p>"I must take your names, gentlemen, in case
it should be necessary to proceed for breach of
peace."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to stop the fight?" cried
Armitage, in a passion of indignation. "I'm
Mr. Armitage, of Croxley, and this is Mr. Wilson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and we'll be responsible that all is fair and
as it should be.'</p>

<p>"I'll take the names in case it should be
necessary to proceed," said the inspector, impassively.</p>

<p>"But you know me well."</p>

<p>"If you was a dook or even a judge it
would be all the same," said the inspector.
"It's the law, and there's an end. I'll not
take upon myself to stop the fight, seeing that
gloves are to be used, but I'll take the names
of all concerned. Silas Craggs, Robert Montgomery,
Edward Barton, James Stapleton, of
London. Who seconds Silas Craggs?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the woman. "Yes, you can
stare, but it's my job, and no one else's. Anastasia's
the name&mdash;four a's."</p>

<p>"Craggs?"</p>

<p>"Johnson. Anastasia Johnson. If you
jug him, you can jug me."</p>

<p>"Who talked of juggin', ye fool?" growled
the Master. "Coom on, Mr. Armitage, for
I'm fair sick o' this loiterin'."</p>

<p>The inspector fell in with the procession,
and proceeded, as they walked up the hill, to
bargain in his official capacity for a front seat,
where he could safeguard the interests of the
law, and in his private capacity to lay out
thirty shillings at seven to one with Mr. Armitage.
Through the door they passed, down a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
narrow lane walled with a dense bank of humanity,
up a wooden ladder to a platform, over
a rope which was slung waist-high from four
corner-stakes, and then Montgomery realized
that he was in that ring in which his immediate
destiny was to be worked out. On the stake
at one corner there hung a blue-and-white
streamer. Barton led him across, the overcoat
dangling loosely from his shoulders, and he sat
down on a wooden stool. Barton and another
man, both wearing white sweaters, stood beside
him. The so-called ring was a square, twenty
feet each way. At the opposite angle was the
sinister figure of the Master, with his red-headed
woman and a rough-faced friend to
look after him. At each corner were metal
basins, pitchers of water, and sponges.</p>

<p>During the hubbub and uproar of the entrance
Montgomery was too bewildered to take
things in. But now there was a few minutes'
delay, for the referee had lingered behind, and
so he looked quietly about him. It was a sight
to haunt him for a lifetime. Wooden seats
had been built in, sloping upwards to the tops
of the walls. Above, instead of a ceiling, a
great flight of crows passed slowly across a
square of grey cloud. Right up to the top-most
benches the folk were banked&mdash;broadcloth
in front, corduroys and fustian behind;
faces turned everywhere upon him. The grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
reek of the pipes filled the building, and the
air was pungent with the acrid smell of cheap,
strong tobacco. Everywhere among the human
faces were to be seen the heads of the
dogs. They growled and yapped from the
back benches. In that dense mass of humanity
one could hardly pick out individuals,
but Montgomery's eyes caught the brazen
gleam of the helmets held upon the knees of
the ten yeomen of his escort. At the very
edge of the platform sat the reporters, five of
them: three locals, and two all the way from
London. But where was the all-important
referee? There was no sign of him, unless he
were in the centre of that angry swirl of men
near the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Stapleton had stopped to examine the
gloves which were to be used, and entered the
building after the combatants. He had started
to come down that narrow lane with the human
walls which led to the ring. But already it
had gone abroad that the Wilson champion
was a gentleman, and that another gentleman
had been appointed as referee. A wave of
suspicion passed through the Croxley folk.
They would have one of their own people for
a referee. They would not have a stranger.
His path was stopped as he made for the ring.
Excited men flung themselves in front of him;
they waved their fists in his face and cursed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
him. A woman howled vile names in his ear.
Somebody struck at him with an umbrella.
"Go thou back to Lunnon. We want noan
o' thee. Go thou back!" they yelled.</p>

<p>Stapleton, with his shiny hat cocked backwards,
and his large, bulging forehead swelling
from under it, looked round him from beneath
his bushy brows. He was in the centre of a
savage and dangerous mob. Then he drew
his watch from his pocket and held it dial
upwards in his palm.</p>

<p>"In three minutes," said he, "I will declare
the fight off."</p>

<p>They raged round him. His cool face and
that aggressive top-hat irritated them. Grimy
hands were raised. But it was difficult, somehow,
to strike a man who was so absolutely
indifferent.</p>

<p>"In two minutes I declare the fight off."</p>

<p>They exploded into blasphemy. The breath
of angry men smoked into his placid face. A
gnarled, grimy fist vibrated at the end of his
nose. "We tell thee we want noan o' thee.
Get thou back where thou com'st from."</p>

<p>"In one minute I declare the fight off."</p>

<p>Then the calm persistence of the man conquered
the swaying, mutable, passionate crowd.</p>

<p>"Let him through, mon. Happen there'll
be no fight after a'."</p>

<p>"Let him through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bill, thou loomp, let him pass. Dost want
the fight declared off?"</p>

<p>"Make room for the referee!&mdash;room for the
Lunnon referee!"</p>

<p>And half pushed, half carried, he was swept
up to the ring. There were two chairs by the
side of it, one for him and one for the timekeeper.
He sat down, his hands on his knees,
his hat at a more wonderful angle than ever,
impassive but solemn, with the aspect of one
who appreciates his responsibilities.</p>

<p>Mr. Armitage, the portly butcher, made his
way into the ring and held up two fat hands,
sparkling with rings, as a signal for silence.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" he yelled. And then in a
crescendo shriek, "Gentlemen!"</p>

<p>"And ladies!" cried somebody, for indeed
there was a fair sprinkling of women among the
crowd. "Speak up, owd man!" shouted another.
"What price pork chops?" cried somebody
at the back. Everybody laughed, and
the dogs began to bark. Armitage waved his
hands amidst the uproar as if he were conducting
an orchestra. At last the babel thinned
into silence.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he yelled, "the match is between
Silas Craggs, whom we call the Master
of Croxley, and Robert Montgomery, of the
Wilson Coal-pits. The match was to be under
eleven-eight. When they were weighed just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
now Craggs weighed eleven-seven, and Montgomery
ten-nine. The conditions of the contest
are&mdash;the best of twenty three-minute
rounds with two-ounce gloves. Should the
fight run to its full length it will, of course, be
decided upon points. Mr. Stapleton, the well-known
London referee, has kindly consented
to see fair play. I wish to say that Mr. Wilson
and I, the chief backers of the two men, have
every confidence in Mr. Stapleton, and that we
beg that you will accept his rulings without dispute."</p>

<p>He then turned from one combatant to the
other, with a wave of his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>III</h2>

<p class="cap">MONTGOMERY&mdash;Craggs!" said he.</p>

<p>A great hush fell over the huge assembly.
Even the dogs stopped yapping; one
might have thought that the monstrous room
was empty. The two men had stood up, the
small white gloves over their hands. They advanced
from their corners and shook hands:
Montgomery, gravely, Craggs with a smile.
Then they fell into position. The crowd gave
a long sigh&mdash;the intake of a thousand excited
breaths. The referee tilted his chair on to its
back legs, and looked moodily critical from the
one to the other.</p>

<p>It was strength against activity&mdash;that was evident
from the first. The Master stood stolidly
upon his K-leg. It gave him a tremendous
pedestal; one could hardly imagine his
being knocked down. And he could pivot
round upon it with extraordinary quickness;
but his advance or retreat was ungainly. His
frame, however, was so much larger and broader
than that of the student, and his brown, massive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
face looked so resolute and menacing, that
the hearts of the Wilson party sank within
them. There was one heart, however, which
had not done so. It was that of Robert Montgomery.</p>

<p>Any nervousness which he may have had
completely passed away now that he had his
work before him. Here was something definite&mdash;this
hard-faced, deformed Hercules to beat,
with a career as the price of beating him. He
glowed with the joy of action; it thrilled through
his nerves. He faced his man with little in-and-out
steps, breaking to the left, breaking to
the right, feeling his way, while Craggs, with a
dull, malignant eye, pivoted slowly upon his
weak leg, his left arm half extended, his right
sunk low across the mark. Montgomery led
with his left, and then led again, getting lightly
home each time. He tried again, but the Master
had his counter ready, and Montgomery
reeled back from a harder blow than he had
given. Anastasia, the woman, gave a shrill cry
of encouragement, and her man let fly his right.
Montgomery ducked under it, and in an instant
the two were in each other's arms.</p>

<p>"Break away! Break away!" said the
referee.</p>

<p>The Master struck upwards on the break,
and shook Montgomery with the blow. Then
it was "time." It had been a spirited opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
round. The people buzzed into comment and
applause. Montgomery was quite fresh, but
the hairy chest of the Master was rising and
falling. The man passed a sponge over his
head, while Anastasia flapped the towel before
him. "Good lass! Good lass!" cried the
crowd, and cheered her.</p>

<p>The men were up again, the Master grimly
watchful, Montgomery as alert as a kitten.
The Master tried a sudden rush, squattering
along with his awkward gait, but coming faster
than one would think. The student slipped
aside and avoided him. The Master stopped,
grinned, and shook his head. Then he motioned
with his hand as an invitation to Montgomery
to come to him. The student did
so and led with his left, but got a swinging
right counter in the ribs in exchange. The
heavy blow staggered him, and the Master
came scrambling in to complete his advantage;
but Montgomery, with his greater activity,
kept out of danger until the call of
"time." A tame round, and the advantage
with the Master.</p>

<p>"T' Maister's too strong for him," said a
smelter to his neighbour.</p>

<p>"Ay; but t'other's a likely lad. Happen
we'll see some sport yet. He can joomp
rarely."</p>

<p>"But t' Maister can stop and hit rarely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Happen he'll mak' him joomp when he gets
his nief upon him."</p>

<p>They were up again, the water glistening
upon their faces. Montgomery led instantly
and got his right home with a sounding smack
upon the Master's forehead. There was a
shout from the colliers, and "Silence! Order!"
from the referee. Montgomery avoided the
counter and scored with his left. Fresh applause,
and the referee upon his feet in indignation.
"No comments, gentlemen, if <i>you</i>
please, during the rounds."</p>

<p>"Just bide a bit!" growled the Master.</p>

<p>"Don't talk&mdash;fight!" said the referee, angrily.</p>

<p>Montgomery rubbed in the point by a flush
hit upon the mouth, and the Master shambled
back to his corner like an angry bear, having
had all the worst of the round.</p>

<p>"Where's thot seven to one?" shouted Purvis,
the publican. "I'll take six to one!"</p>

<p>There were no answers.</p>

<p>"Five to one!" There were givers at that.
Purvis booked them in a tattered notebook.</p>

<p>Montgomery began to feel happy. He lay
back with his legs outstretched, his back against
the corner-post, and one gloved hand upon each
rope. What a delicious minute it was between
each round. If he could only keep out of
harm's way, he must surely wear this man out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
before the end of twenty rounds. He was
so slow that all his strength went for nothing.
"You're fightin' a winnin' fight&mdash;a winnin'
fight," Ted Barton whispered in his ear. "Go
canny; tak' no chances; you have him proper."</p>

<p>But the Master was crafty. He had fought
so many battles with his maimed limb that he
knew how to make the best of it. Warily and
slowly he man&oelig;uvred round Montgomery, stepping
forward and yet again forward until he had
imperceptibly backed him into his corner. The
student suddenly saw a flash of triumph upon
the grim face, and a gleam in the dull, malignant
eyes. The Master was upon him. He
sprang aside and was on the ropes. The Master
smashed in one of his terrible upper-cuts,
and Montgomery half broke it with his guard.
The student sprang the other way and was
against the other converging rope. He was
trapped in the angle. The Master sent in another,
with a hoggish grunt which spoke of the
energy behind it. Montgomery ducked, but
got a jab from the left upon the mark. He
closed with his man. "Break away! Break
away?" cried the referee. Montgomery disengaged,
and got a swinging blow on the ear as
he did so. It had been a damaging round for
him, and the Croxley people were shouting their
delight.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I will <i>not</i> have this noise!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Stapleton roared. "I have been accustomed to
preside at a well-conducted club, and not at a
bear-garden." This little man, with the tilted
hat and the bulging forehead, dominated the
whole assembly. He was like a headmaster
among his boys. He glared round him, and
nobody cared to meet his eye.</p>

<p>Anastasia had kissed the Master when he resumed
his seat. "Good lass. Do't again!"
cried the laughing crowd, and the angry Master
shook his glove at her, as she flapped her towel
in front of him. Montgomery was weary and
a little sore, but not depressed. He had learned
something. He would not again be tempted
into danger.</p>

<p>For three rounds the honours were fairly
equal. The student's hitting was the quicker,
the Master's the harder. Profiting by his lesson,
Montgomery kept himself in the open,
and refused to be herded into a corner. Sometimes
the Master succeeded in rushing him to
the side-ropes, but the younger man slipped
away, or closed and then disengaged. The
monotonous "Break away! Break away!"
of the referee broke in upon the quick, low
patter of rubber-soled shoes, the dull thud of
the blows, and the sharp, hissing breath of two
tired men.</p>

<p>The ninth round found both of them in
fairly good condition. Montgomery's head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was still singing from the blow that he had in
the corner, and one of his thumbs pained him
acutely and seemed to be dislocated. The
Master showed no sign of a touch, but his
breathing was the more laboured, and a long
line of ticks upon the referee's paper showed
that the student had a good show of points.
But one of this iron-man's blows was worth
three of his, and he knew that without the
gloves he could not have stood for three rounds
against him. All the amateur work that he
had done was the merest tapping and flapping
when compared to those frightful blows, from
arms toughened by the shovel and the crowbar.</p>

<p>It was the tenth round, and the fight was
half over. The betting now was only three to
one, for the Wilson champion had held his own
much better than had been expected. But
those who knew the ringcraft as well as the
staying power of the old prize-fighter knew
that the odds were still a long way in his favour.</p>

<p>"Have a care of him!" whispered Barton,
as he sent his man up to the scratch. "Have
a care! He'll play thee a trick, if he can."</p>

<p>But Montgomery saw, or imagined he saw,
that his antagonist was tiring. He looked
jaded and listless, and his hands drooped a little
from their position. His own youth and condition
were beginning to tell. He sprang in
and brought off a fine left-handed lead. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Master's return lacked his usual fire. Again
Montgomery led, and again he got home.
Then he tried his right upon the mark, and the
Master guarded it downwards.</p>

<p>"Too low! Too low! A foul! A foul!"
yelled a thousand voices.</p>

<p>The referee rolled his sardonic eyes slowly
round. "Seems to me this buildin' is chock-full
of referees," said he.</p>

<p>The people laughed and applauded, but
their favour was as immaterial to him as their
anger.</p>

<p>"No applause, please! This is not a
theatre!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Montgomery was very pleased with himself.
His adversary was evidently in a bad way. He
was piling on his points and establishing a lead.
He might as well make hay while the sun
shone. The Master was looking all abroad.
Montgomery popped one upon his blue jowl
and got away without a return. And then the
Master suddenly dropped both his hands and
began rubbing his thigh. Ah! that was it, was
it? He had muscular cramp.</p>

<p>"Go in! Go in!" cried Teddy Barton.</p>

<p>Montgomery sprang wildly forward, and the
next instant was lying half senseless, with his
neck nearly broken, in the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>The whole round had been a long conspiracy
to tempt him within reach of one of those terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
right-hand upper-cuts for which the
Master was famous. For this the listless,
weary bearing, for this the cramp in the thigh.
When Montgomery had sprang in so hotly he
had exposed himself to such a blow as neither
flesh nor blood could stand. Whizzing up
from below with a rigid arm, which put the
Master's eleven stone into its force, it struck
him under the jaw: he whirled half round, and
fell a helpless and half-paralyzed mass. A
vague groan and murmur, inarticulate, too excited
for words, rose from the great audience.
With open mouths and staring eyes they gazed
at the twitching and quivering figure.</p>

<p>"Stand back! Stand right back!" shrieked
the referee, for the Master was standing over
his man ready to give him the <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> as
he rose.</p>

<p>"Stand back, Craggs, this instant!" Stapleton
repeated.</p>

<p>The Master sank his hands sulkily and
walked backwards to the rope with his ferocious
eyes fixed upon his fallen antagonist. The
timekeeper called the seconds. If ten of them
passed before Montgomery rose to his feet, the
fight was ended. Ted Barton wrung his hands
and danced about in an agony in his corner.</p>

<p>As if in a dream&mdash;a terrible nightmare&mdash;the
student could hear the voice of the timekeeper&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;he
got up on his hand&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
was on his knee, sick, swimming,
faint, but resolute to rise. Eight&mdash;he was up,
and the Master was on him like a tiger, lashing
savagely at him with both hands. Folk
held their breath as they watched those terrible
blows, and anticipated the pitiful end&mdash;so much
more pitiful where a game but helpless man
refuses to accept defeat.</p>

<p>Strangely automatic is the human brain.
Without volition, without effort, there shot
into the memory of this bewildered, staggering,
half-stupefied man the one thing which could
have saved him&mdash;that blind eye of which the
Master's son had spoken. It was the same as
the other to look at, but Montgomery remembered
that he had said that it was the left. He
reeled to the left side, half felled by a drive
which lit upon his shoulder. The Master
pivoted round upon his leg and was at him in
an instant.</p>

<p>"Yark him, lad! yark him!" screamed the
woman.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said the referee.</p>

<p>Montgomery slipped to the left again and
yet again; but the Master was too quick and
clever for him. He struck round and got him
full on the face as he tried once more to break
away. Montgomery's knees weakened under
him, and he fell with a groan on the floor.
This time he knew that he was done. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bitter agony he realized, as he groped blindly
with his hands, that he could not possibly
raise himself. Far away and muffled he heard,
amid the murmurs of the multitude, the fateful
voice of the timekeeper counting off the
seconds.</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time!" said the referee.</p>

<p>Then the pent-up passion of the great assembly
broke loose. Croxley gave a deep
groan of disappointment. The Wilsons were
on their feet, yelling with delight. There was
still a chance for them. In four more seconds
their man would have been solemnly counted
out. But now he had a minute in which to
recover. The referee looked round with relaxed
features and laughing eyes. He loved
this rough game, this school for humble heroes,
and it was pleasant to him to intervene as
a <i>Deux ex machin&acirc;</i> at so dramatic a moment.
His chair and his hat were both tilted at an
extreme angle; he and the timekeeper smiled
at each other. Ted Barton and the other second
had rushed out and thrust an arm each
under Montgomery's knee, the other behind
his loins, and so carried him back to his stool.
His head lolled upon his shoulder, but a
douche of cold water sent a shiver through
him, and he started and looked round him.</p>

<p>"He's a' right!" cried the people round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
"He's a rare brave lad. Good lad! Good
lad!" Barton poured some brandy into his
mouth. The mists cleared a little, and he realized
where he was and what he had to do.
But he was still very weak, and he hardly dared
to hope that he could survive another round.</p>

<p>"Seconds out of the ring!" cried the referee.
"Time!"</p>

<p>The Croxley Master sprang eagerly off his
stool.</p>

<p>"Keep clear of him! Go easy for a bit,"
said Barton, and Montgomery walked out to
meet his man once more.</p>

<p>He had had two lessons&mdash;the one when the
Master got him into his corner, the other when
he had been lured into mixing it up with so
powerful an antagonist. Now he would be
wary. Another blow would finish him; he
could afford to run no risks. The Master was
determined to follow up his advantage, and
rushed at him, slogging furiously right and
left. But Montgomery was too young and
active to be caught. He was strong upon his
legs once more, and his wits had all come back
to him. It was a gallant sight&mdash;the line-of-battleship
trying to pour its overwhelming
broadside into the frigate, and the frigate
man&oelig;uvring always so as to avoid it. The
Master tried all his ring-craft. He coaxed the
student up by pretended inactivity; he rushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
at him with furious rushes towards the ropes.
For three rounds he exhausted every wile in
trying to get at him. Montgomery during all
this time was conscious that his strength was
minute by minute coming back to him. The
spinal jar from an upper-cut is overwhelming,
but evanescent. He was losing all sense of
it beyond a great stiffness of the neck. For
the first round after his downfall he had been
content to be entirely on the defensive, only
too happy if he could stall off the furious attacks
of the Master. In the second he occasionally
ventured upon a light counter. In
the third he was smacking back merrily where
he saw an opening. His people yelled their
approval of him at the end of every round.
Even the iron-workers cheered him with that
fine unselfishness which true sport engenders.
To most of them, unspiritual and unimaginative,
the sight of this clean-limbed young
Apollo, rising above disaster and holding on
while consciousness was in him to his appointed
task, was the greatest thing their experience
had ever known.</p>

<p>But the Master's naturally morose temper
became more and more murderous at this
postponement of his hopes. Three rounds ago
the battle had been in his hands; now it was all
to do over again. Round by round his man
was recovering his strength. By the fifteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he was strong again in wind and limb. But the
vigilant Anastasia saw something which encouraged
her.</p>

<p>"That bash in t' ribs is telling on him, Jock,"
she whispered. "Why else should he be gulping
t' brandy? Go in, lad, and thou hast him
yet."</p>

<p>Montgomery had suddenly taken the flask
from Barton's hand, and had a deep pull at the
contents. Then, with his face a little flushed,
and with a curious look of purpose, which made
the referee stare hard at him, in his eyes, he
rose for the sixteenth round.</p>

<p>"Game as a pairtridge!" cried the publican,
as he looked at the hard-set face.</p>

<p>"Mix it oop, lad; mix it oop!" cried the
iron-men to their Master.</p>

<p>And then a hum of exultation ran through
their ranks as they realized that their tougher,
harder, stronger man held the vantage, after
all.</p>

<p>Neither of the men showed much sign of
punishment. Small gloves crush and numb,
but they do not cut. One of the Master's eyes
was even more flush with his cheek than Nature
had made it. Montgomery had two or
three livid marks upon his body, and his face
was haggard, save for that pink spot which the
brandy had brought into either cheek. He
rocked a little as he stood opposite his man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and his hands drooped as if he felt the gloves
to be an unutterable weight. It was evident
that he was spent and desperately weary. If
he received one other blow it must surely be
fatal to him. If he brought one home, what
power could there be behind it, and what chance
was there of its harming the colossus in front
of him? It was the crisis of the fight. This
round must decide it. "Mix it oop, lad; mix
it oop!" the iron-men whooped. Even the
savage eyes of the referee were unable to restrain
the excited crowd.</p>

<p>Now, at last, the chance had come for Montgomery.
He had learned a lesson from his
more experienced rival. Why should he not
play his own game upon him? He was spent,
but not nearly so spent as he pretended. That
brandy was to call up his reserves, to let him
have strength to take full advantage of the
opening when it came. It was thrilling and
tingling through his veins, at the very moment
when he was lurching and rocking like a beaten
man. He acted his part admirably. The
Master felt that there was an easy task before
him, and rushed in with ungainly activity to
finish it once for all. He slap-banged away
left and right, boring Montgomery up against
the ropes, swinging in his ferocious blows with
those animal grunts which told of the vicious
energy behind them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>But Montgomery was too cool to fall a
victim to any of those murderous upper-cuts.
He kept out of harm's way with a rigid guard,
an active foot, and a head which was swift to
duck. And yet he contrived to present the
same appearance of a man who is hopelessly
done. The Master, weary from his own
shower of blows, and fearing nothing from so
weak a man, dropped his hand for an instant,
and at that instant Montgomery's right came
home.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent blow, straight, clean,
crisp, with the force of the loins and the back
behind it. And it landed where he had meant
it to&mdash;upon the exact point of that blue-grained
chin. Flesh and blood could not stand such a
blow in such a place. Neither valour nor
hardihood can save the man to whom it comes.
The Master fell backwards, flat, prostrate,
striking the ground with so simultaneous a clap
that it was like a shutter falling from a wall.
A yell which no referee could control broke
from the crowded benches as the giant went
down. He lay upon his back, his knees a
little drawn up, his huge chest panting. He
twitched and shook, but could not move. His
feet pawed convulsively once or twice. It was
no use. He was done. "Eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten!"
said the timekeeper, and the roar of a thousand
voices, with a deafening clap like the broadside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of a ship, told that the Master of Croxley was
the Master no more.</p>

<p>Montgomery stood half dazed, looking down
at the huge, prostrate figure. He could hardly
realize that it was indeed all over. He saw the
referee motion towards him with his hand. He
heard his name bellowed in triumph from every
side. And then he was aware of some one
rushing towards him; he caught a glimpse of a
flushed face and an aureole of flying red hair,
a gloveless fist struck him between the eyes,
and he was on his back in the ring beside his
antagonist, while a dozen of his supporters
were endeavouring to secure the frantic Anastasia.
He heard the angry shouting of the
referee, the screaming of the furious woman,
and the cries of the mob. Then something
seemed to break like an over-stretched banjo-string,
and he sank into the deep, deep, mist-girt
abyss of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The dressing was like a thing in a dream,
and so was a vision of the Master with the grin
of a bulldog upon his face, and his three teeth
amiably protruded. He shook Montgomery
heartily by the hand.</p>

<p>"I would have been rare pleased to shake
thee by the throttle, lad, a short while syne,"
said he. "But I bear no ill-feelin' again' thee.
It was a rare poonch that brought me down&mdash;I
have not had a better since my second fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wi' Billy Edwards in '89. Happen thou might
think o' goin' further wi' this business. If thou
dost, and want a trainer, there's not much inside
t' ropes as I don't know. Or happen thou
might like to try it wi' me old style and bare
knuckles. Thou hast but to write to t' iron-works
to find me."</p>

<p>But Montgomery disclaimed any such ambition.
A canvas bag with his share&mdash;one hundred
and ninety sovereigns&mdash;was handed to
him, of which he gave ten to the Master, who
also received some share of the gate-money.</p>

<p>Then, with young Wilson escorting him on
one side, Purvis on the other, and Fawcett
carrying his bag behind, he went in triumph to
his carriage, and drove amid a long roar, which
lined the highway like a hedge for the seven
miles, back to his starting-point.</p>

<p>"It's the greatest thing I ever saw in my life.
By George, it's ripping!" cried Wilson, who
had been left in a kind of ecstasy by the events
of the day. "There's a chap over Barnsley
way who fancies himself a bit. Let us spring
you on him, and let him see what he can make
of you. We'll put up a purse&mdash;won't we, Purvis?
You shall never want a backer."</p>

<p>"At his weight," said the publican, "I'm
behind him, I am, for twenty rounds, and no
age, country, or color barred."</p>

<p>"So am I!" cried Fawcett; "middle-weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
champion of the world, that's what he is&mdash;here,
in the same carriage with us."</p>

<p>But Montgomery was not to be beguiled.</p>

<p>"No; I have my own work to do now."</p>

<p>"And what may that be?"</p>

<p>"I'll use this money to get my medical degree."</p>

<p>"Well, we've plenty of doctors, but you're
the only man in the Riding that could smack
the Croxley Master off his legs. However, I
suppose you know your own business best.
When you're a doctor, you'd best come down
into these parts, and you'll always find a job
waiting for you at the Wilson Coal-pits."</p>

<p>Montgomery had returned by devious ways
to the surgery. The horses were smoking at
the door, and the doctor was just back from his
long journey. Several patients had called in
his absence, and he was in the worst of
tempers.</p>

<p>"I suppose I should be glad that you have
come back at all, Mr. Montgomery!" he
snarled. "When next you elect to take a
holiday, I trust, it will not be at so busy a
time."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, that you should have been
inconvenienced."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have been exceedingly inconvenienced."
Here, for the first time, he looked
hard at the assistant. "Good heavens, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Montgomery, what have you been doing with
your left eye?"</p>

<p>It was where Anastasia had lodged her protest.</p>

<p>Montgomery laughed. "It is nothing, sir,"
said he.</p>

<p>"And you have a livid mark under your jaw.
It is, indeed, terrible that my representative
should be going about in so disreputable a condition.
How did you receive these injuries?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, as you know, there was a little
glove-fight to-day over at Croxley."</p>

<p>"And you got mixed up with that brutal
crowd?"</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> rather mixed up with them."</p>

<p>"And who assaulted you?"</p>

<p>"One of the fighters."</p>

<p>"Which of them?"</p>

<p>"The Master of Croxley."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Perhaps you interfered
with him?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, I did a little."</p>

<p>"Mr. Montgomery, in such a practice as
mine, intimately associated as it is with the
highest and most progressive elements of our
small community, it is impossible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then the tentative bray of a cornet-player
searching for his keynote jarred upon
their ears, and an instant later the Wilson Colliery
brass band was in full cry with, "See the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Conquering Hero Comes," outside the surgery
window. There was a banner waving, and a
shouting crowd of miners.</p>

<p>"What is it? What does it mean?" cried
the angry doctor.</p>

<p>"It means, sir, that I have, in the only way
which was open to me, earned the money which
is necessary for my education. It is my duty,
Doctor Oldacre, to warn you that I am about
to return to the University, and that you should
lose no time in appointing my successor."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
